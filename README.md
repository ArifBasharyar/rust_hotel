# Rusty hotel

This is a simple conversion of my c++ course endproject to rust.  
The code is not yet final and is more like c++ than actual rust code.  
I did try some optimization and improvements, but there's still lots of work to do.

## TODO

1. Implement hotel in main.
1. Implement menu properly in main.
1. Write more Comments.
1. Remove "allow unused code" macros and the need for it.
1. Write some tests.
1. Use more options and/or results for error handling.
1. Use more functional programming.
